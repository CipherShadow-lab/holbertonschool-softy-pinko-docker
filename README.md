Docker is a platform that allows applications to be containerised, meaning they can be packaged into portable, self-contained environments that can run anywhere. 
This means that applications can be quickly moved from one environment to another, such as from a local computer to a server - without worrying about dependencies or configuration issues. 
Docker achieves this by using containers, which are isolated environments that contain everything an application needs to run, such as libraries, dependencies, and configurations. 

Docker containers are lightweight and can be started and stopped quickly - making them ideal for modern software development and deployment. With Docker, applications can also be quickly scaled by running multiple containers of the same application on different hosts (or the same host). This allows them to be easily managed using Docker Compose adn/or other orchestration tools.

Ultimately, this project entails creating infrastructure for an application that utilizes a reverse proxy, a load balancer, two application servers, and one front-end server.
